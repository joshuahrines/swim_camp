# benchmarks_comp.py
initial attempt at making benchmark results sheets, ended up wasting a lot of paper so i moved to the "green" and "greener" versions. spits out benchmark_assignments_wk1_garnet.xlsx (just an example - wk and group could change)

# benchmarks_green.py
second iteration of benchmark results sheets, this puts whole week-worth of benchmarks on one sheet (per lane) so narrows down paper usage from 32 (per group) to 8 (per group). also adds in the add-up feature, allowing user to simply enter split times from benchmarks.  spits out benchmark_green_wk1_garnet.xlsx (just an example - wk and group could change)

# benchmarks_greener.py
third iteration; simply adds in a 'heatsheet' tab to the spreadsheets - something to print out and paste on the wall so the kids know where they're going, everything else the same.  spits out benchmark_greener_wk1_garnet.xlsx (just an example - wk and group could change)

# section_assignments files
code pulls from these files to create the spreadsheets
